    "eventDetails": "✨ What is YONI STEAMING: Yoni is the Sanskrit word for womb or Vulva, also it means that our Yoni (vulva) is sacred. Yoni steaming is an ancient practice that has been used for hundreds of years to assist with many symptoms. Yoni steaming has been referenced in ancient texts and used by midwives for hundreds of years. The Yoni steam process involves sitting over a steaming pot of herb-infused water, generally for about 10-30 minutes per session depending on your body. As the steam rises and the herbs penetrate vaginal tissue, then the vagina and uterus are cleansed and soothed. Benefits Yoni steaming benefits include improving menopausal symptoms, cleansing the uterus, and balancing hormones, which can help to regulate periods and ease unpleasant symptoms of menstruation such as cramps, headaches, and vaginal discomfort. Regulating your menstrual cycle, curing uterine prolapse and heavy bleeding, and increasing fertility in women who have not yet conceived.\nConnect with traumas, abuses, and emotions, and release and heal them. Yoni Steam Herbs The herbs you use for vaginal steaming are important. There are a variety of different yoni steam herbs, and they all have different healing. Some herbs you may already have in your kitchen or garden. In my session, I use my intuition to guide me to choose the herbs that my client needs. Yoni steam ingredients generally involve some combination of the following herbs: Basil (cleansing) Rosemary (anti-bacterial and anti-microbial) Oregano (antiseptic) Calendula (anti-inflammatory) Motherwort (cleansing, pain-relieving) Mugwort (all-purpose) Lavender (anti-microbial) Marigolds (anti-inflammatory) Thyme (anti-bacterial and anti-microbial) Each herb used for steaming has its unique benefits, and the right herbs for your mixture depend on your specific needs and wants. ✨ On my Yoni steam session, I give Reiki while you're steaming, then I'll guide you through breathing so we activate the pranas (energy) on the body, you start to feel more connected with the present moment and your heart, with this connection you may be able to access some trauma or wounds that you passed and still on your body, on this deeper level we can release what doesn't serves you anymore, then you can feel a beautiful blossom with your divine feminine. Additionally, people who suffer from severe period symptoms such as bloating, discomfort, or painful cramps will likely benefit from steaming two or three times in the week leading up to their period. Ultimately, the frequency at which you choose to yoni steam depends on your personal needs, comfort level, and cycle. You can't do it during your period or if you are pregnant. ✨ Yoni steam - Exchange €80 duration 90 minutes to 120 minutes 🌼Book your session on the link\nhttps://app.ubindi.com/schedule ✨I'm based in Rathborne and Temple Bar ✨Learn how your body is communicating with you all the time, you just need to be willing to start this new healing journey!\n✨Be responsible for your BODY, for your LIFE.\n✨Learn to listen to yourself, to respect yourself, to forgive and thus become emotionally stronger and no longer feel pain.\n✨ Come and talk to me, I'm with my heart open to listen to you, let's find the best way to navigate your body's memories, pain, or emotions, walking together to discover the emotional and affective cause, strengthening you're throughout the process of connecting with your true self. ♥️ Love and gratitude ♥️\nKarina Rodrigues Connection\nContact: 089.9692341 https://www.instagram.com/p/Cr-7QvitCpk/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==",
