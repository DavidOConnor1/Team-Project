    "eventDetails": "The meaning of the word zen is meditation, zazen means sitting meditation. In zazen practice we begin to know ourselves, and to go beyond the limits of our personal ego. Within our tradition zazen is referred to as shikantaza, not doing, letting go of thoughts, dropping off body and mind. This sitting meditation is the focus of our practice. Language limits our ability to communicate the true nature of zen; it is something that is better understood\nthrough practice. We are open to everyone interested in learning about zen.\nIntro workshop for newcomers is available at 5.30pm each Sunday. The dojo is a sacred place and it is important to be considerate of everyone. We have many people that travel to practise together once a week or once a month. So for that reason it is really essential that we all know the structure of the sitting practise (when to sit, how to do Kinhin, the different bell sounds and their meaning etc), to ensure a silent, safe and meaningful meditation. And it's also great to meet everyone before the sitting practise. And answer any questions you may have. We have zafus and zabutons (mats and cushions) for all to sit on. Chairs are available too. Comfortable clothing for sitting, black or neutral tones best. We greatly appreciate a donation of ‚Ç¨5 to cover costs if it's possible for you. Please arrive 10min before start so 6ish (if you're not doing the intro workshop). You are very welcome to our dojo!",

    "eventDetails": "From a Chinese medecine perspective, acupuncture helps to regulate our emotions (energy). Negative emotions block our bodies. We have four energy bodies in addition to our physical body (the etheric, emotional, mental and spiritual body). Anything that happens in the physical body has to happen first in the etheric body, which is an energy twin of the physical body. Acupuncture works on the etheric energy body which then connects with all the other bodies. So in other words, Acupuncture heals on all four levels: emotionally, mentally, physically and spiritually. It does this by balancing all the masculine (yang) and feminine (yin) energies. We need both of these to be healthy, but when these two energies are not balanced, you will feel unaligned and this will manifest as physical or mental symptons. The root cause of disease is due to emotional or mental issues. From a Western Medicine perspective, Acupuncture stimulates the nerves beside the acupuncture points along the body, sending neuro signals to the brain to release hormones, feel good chemicals and endorphins which are the bodys' natural pain killer. In other words, it helps the body to heal itself! unlike modern medications which have very bad side effects, Acupuncture is a totally safe and natural treatment with absolutely no side effects. Come along to learn about the oldest natural medicinal system used all over the world (70%) and recognised as a safe and effective treatment for many medical conditions by the World Health Organisation (WHO). We can discuss in an informal environment, about your symptons and see if acupuncture can help you. it's FREE!! to attend, and if you decide to get a treatment after the consultation, then a minimum donation of 20 euro, (but this is NOT obligatory, exclusive to meet up members only). For normal private one to one sessions, please enquire (price 50 euro). Have you been experiencing any unexplained symptons? have you been for tests but they have all come back negative, yet somehow you still feel that something is not quite right? Well it's time to sit up and listen to your body before its too late. It's trying to tell you something! When you have blockage in your body and if it is left untreated, it can develop into something very serious in the long term such as cardiac issues, cancer, alzheimers, etc. Adrenal fatigue is the state your body ends up in when you have been pushing yourself too hard for too long. Living off of adrenaline and stress hormones while not taking time to recover or recharge is detrimental to your health, and the feeling of adrenal fatigue can be mild to severe and includes four different stages. The most common symptoms include feeling chronically tired and run-down no matter how much you sleep, an inability to focus, a low tolerance to sound and bright lights, sleep disturbances, feeling tired yet wired at night, or wanting to sleep all the time. Other symptoms can be that stimulants don't work like they used to, you have low immunity and get sick more frequently, and you feel overwhelmed with day-to-day responsibilities. Acupuncture can help to restore your energy levels, and bring your mind and body back to balance, thereby improving all symptons.",

We try to keep an eye out for people there their first time, to make sure they feel welcomed. We have all been there. We'll have board games there on the night but do feel free to bring your own too. Games are always explained, so don't worry about not knowing the rules of new games. Late comers always welcome :) The meet ups are free of charge but we do ask that people support that bar by buying food and/or drink. The bar is very accommodating to us and it's important that we support them in return. Bringing in outside food or drink is completely unacceptable. I'd suggest commenting below with what games you're going to bring along and people can comment if they want to play. More info and location here: https://galwaybaybrewery.com/blacksheep/",

From the meeting point we will walk to the entrance of Howth Castle and see the castle from the outside. We will then see a large dolmen called Aideen's Tomb and then climb the hill to Muck Rock with excellent views over Howth Castle, North Bull Island and further afield. After a short break near the top of the hill we will join one of the main paths into Howth village, famous for fish and chips. We will probably stope for refreshments in Howth before taking the DART back into Dublin. [Date] 14th April (SUNDAY) [Time] 12:30 ~ 16:00 [Place] Outside Howth Station (by the exit which is above the Bloody Stream pub). If you come out of the other exit then please walk around the station to the front exit. There's a train departing Dublin Connolly at 12:01 that gets into Howth at 12:29. It starts in Greystones (departing at 11:04) and stops at all stations to Howth so you can board it at the station nearest to where you live. Alternatively Howth Station is served by Dublin Bus 6 and H3 from Lower Abbey Street. We hope to see you there! [Host(s)] Tim (085 718 5658) WhatsApp *** If you wish to wander off during a break then it's probably OK but please agree with the organisers a time you'll return so we're not waiting for you *** Feel free to come on the walk even if you haven't been to a meet up before. This is a great way to meet new people and see new places. FAQs PLEASE NOTE: Walking like many outdoor activities carries an element of risk. People who take part in our meet up activities do so at their own risk and are responsible for their own actions and involvement. If you register to join our meet up walks you agree that you wish to take part in the activities knowing these risks.

We Kayak along the coastline from Beach North towards the Lighthouse. We pass a Martello tower, one of many of built along the coast of Ireland. These Towers were built during the 19th century as coastal Forts.Fear of Fear of an invasion by Napoleon Bonaparte reached panic proportions among On this trip we see plenty of sea birds including cormerants, sea gulls and terns on the Cliffs, and hopefully some seals .We kayak out to a point where we can see the daily lighthouse. This kayaking session is suitable for the beginners, but all of you have to be 18 years of age and over and must know how to swim. howth sea kayaking History The Baily Lighthouse is located on a rocky promontory over looking Dublin Bay. It was at this location that the Norse Vikings fled to regroup after the Battle of Clontarf in 1014 and was also the point where they boarded their long boats and left Howth for the last time after the Normans invasion in 1177. In 1667 it was decided to build a light signal here to warn ships of the danger at night. The Bailey Lighthouse as you see it today was built in 1814 and it‚Äôs tower stands 134 feet above the sea. A fog bell was later added in 1853 In 1996, the lighthouse was converted to automatic operation, and the last of the Keepers left in 1997, making Baily the last Irish lighthouse to go automatic.We stop on a small beach area in the base of the cliffs for some refreshments. We do take some photos during the trip which we will upload to the webpage after the trip. The trip follows the coastline North towards the Baily Lighthouse.
