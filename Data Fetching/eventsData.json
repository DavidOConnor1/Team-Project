A school gives us the opportunity to come together as a collective with the dual objective of working on the material and working on ourselves. Through the group we give ourselves a chance to change, transform and most notably, provide a space to awaken and become conscious. A movement practice will provide the platform and broad range of material to contend with. In taking part in a movement school like this I‚Äôll aim to teach material that will help you foster a lifelong movement practice that is independent in its own way and truly unique to you as an individual. We come together as a group to share that unique perspective and elevate our own understanding of movement as part of a community. The school will follow a curriculum based approach in exposing students to what I feel are fundamental practices (listed below) that relate to the field of movement. The teachings will be delivered in an organised, modular and process-based approach in order to present these various systems as a coherent body of knowledge.

    "eventDetails": "This coming Sunday (14th April) we will have a walk in the beautiful rhododendron gardens of Howth Castle, which should be looking good at this time of year. From the meeting point we will walk to the entrance of Howth Castle and see the castle from the outside. We will then see a large dolmen called Aideen's Tomb and then climb the hill to Muck Rock with excellent views over Howth Castle, North Bull Island and further afield. After a short break near the top of the hill we will join one of the main paths into Howth village, famous for fish and chips. We will probably stope for refreshments in Howth before taking the DART back into Dublin. [Date] 14th April (SUNDAY) [Time] 12:30 ~ 16:00 [Place] Outside Howth Station (by the exit which is above the Bloody Stream pub). If you come out of the other exit then please walk around the station to the front exit. There's a train departing Dublin Connolly at 12:01 that gets into Howth at 12:29. It starts in Greystones (departing at 11:04) and stops at all stations to Howth so you can board it at the station nearest to where you live. Alternatively Howth Station is served by Dublin Bus 6 and H3 from Lower Abbey Street. We hope to see you there! [Host(s)] Tim (085 718 5658) WhatsApp *** If you wish to wander off during a break then it's probably OK but please agree with the organisers a time you'll return so we're not waiting for you *** Feel free to come on the walk even if you haven't been to a meet up before. This is a great way to meet new people and see new places. FAQs PLEASE NOTE: Walking like many outdoor activities carries an element of risk. People who take part in our meet up activities do so at their own risk and are responsible for their own actions and involvement. If you register to join our meet up walks you agree that you wish to take part in the activities knowing these risks. Please wear boots, shoes or runners that you find comfortable, provide suitable support and have good grip as some of the paths may be uneven or steep. It is also recommended to bring water to avoid dehydration. Bring warm clothes and a waterproof jacket or umbrella in case of inclement weather. Feel free to bring walking poles if you wish.

    "eventDetails": "About the Trip Come and join us for a fun Kayaking trip around the coastline from Shielmartin road in Howth North towards the Baily Lighthouse.. We Kayak along the coastline from Beach North towards the Lighthouse. We pass a Martello tower, one of many of built along the coast of Ireland. These Towers were built during the 19th century as coastal Forts.Fear of Fear of an invasion by Napoleon Bonaparte reached panic proportions among On this trip we see plenty of sea birds including cormerants, sea gulls and terns on the Cliffs, and hopefully some seals .We kayak out to a point where we can see the daily lighthouse. This kayaking session is suitable for the beginners, but all of you have to be 18 years of age and over and must know how to swim. howth sea kayaking History The Baily Lighthouse is located on a rocky promontory over looking Dublin Bay. It was at this location that the Norse Vikings fled to regroup after the Battle of Clontarf in 1014 and was also the point where they boarded their long boats and left Howth for the last time after the Normans invasion in 1177. In 1667 it was decided to build a light signal here to warn ships of the danger at night. The Bailey Lighthouse as you see it today was built in 1814 and it‚Äôs tower stands 134 feet above the sea. A fog bell was later added in 1853 In 1996, the lighthouse was converted to automatic operation, and the last of the Keepers left in 1997, making Baily the last Irish lighthouse to go automatic.We stop on a small beach area in the base of the cliffs for some refreshments. We do take some photos during the trip which we will upload to the webpage after the trip. The trip follows the coastline North towards the Baily Lighthouse. We take a short break for some refreshments and a few photos before Kayaking back . howth sea kayaking We Will Provide: Payment: You will have to pay a deposit of 5 euros (non-refundable if you don‚Äôt show up and refundable in case we have to cancel kayaking trip due to bad weather).
