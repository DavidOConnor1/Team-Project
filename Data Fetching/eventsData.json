    "eventDetails": "Do you need some time out? To relax and unwind? Join in the Twin Hearts Meditation to help relax you, make your mind calm, feel happier. You might have been interested in doing Meditation because you want to achieve calmness and stillness, or to have a healthier body, purer mind, or maybe to attract positive things, people and increase your good luck. Your intention might even be to become happier, more intelligent, to develop intuition or achieve illumination. It can also be more selfless towards creating a better world for all. Whatever your intention, maybe there is a simple yet effective technique that can take you there. We call it the Meditation on Twin Hearts… Meditation on Twin Hearts is one of the very advanced spiritual techniques, which was given to selected disciples in the past, and now made public through the valuable efforts of GrandMaster Choa Kok Sui. Its secret relies on activating the human energy centers, the Heart and the Crown without which illumination is not possible. There are many ways of activating the heart and crown chakras, such as Hatha yoga, yogic breathing techniques, chanting mantras and visualization techniques. All of these techniques are effective but not fast enough, while one of the most effective and fastest ways still remains the Meditation on Twin Hearts. BENEFITS OF Meditation on Twins Hearts Reduced stress, anxiety and depression It even disintegrates the unwanted emotions and thought-forms within your chakras and aura. You should know that most of these are not yours. Sharper mind and greater happiness Once the unwanted thought forms and emotions are out of your system, your mind becomes clear and your emotions more refined. Improve your relationships As you bless the entire earth with loving-kindness, you will be filled with love energy. This love brings harmony to your relationships. Improved health Once the divine energy flows through you, it naturally flushes the used up and unwanted energies within your system; so after the meditation, you become a fresher you. Become a divine channel The meditation creates an opportunity for you to become a channel to bless every person, every being on earth with a better life. Increase good luck Once you make yourself available to serve, you create lots of good karma that shows itself in life as good luck.",

A school gives us the opportunity to come together as a collective with the dual objective of working on the material and working on ourselves. Through the group we give ourselves a chance to change, transform and most notably, provide a space to awaken and become conscious. A movement practice will provide the platform and broad range of material to contend with. In taking part in a movement school like this I’ll aim to teach material that will help you foster a lifelong movement practice that is independent in its own way and truly unique to you as an individual. We come together as a group to share that unique perspective and elevate our own understanding of movement as part of a community. The school will follow a curriculum based approach in exposing students to what I feel are fundamental practices (listed below) that relate to the field of movement. The teachings will be delivered in an organised, modular and process-based approach in order to present these various systems as a coherent body of knowledge.

We almost always have some first time visitors and we always give them a tour of the space. Come in with your Pi, Arduino, or whatever you have. Bring your laptop. Maybe you want to make something, solder, breadboard or use our electronic gear. Maybe you have some vague ideas and just want to get started. Or maybe you’re just curious……if so, it’s fine to come along and just see what others are doing.

The pace will be approximately 5:20 min/km, and you will need to be able to run at this pace unless there are others clicked into the run who can run an alternative pace with you, as the park is now too dark to run alone in. Please wear hi vis and bring a head or chest light. We meet opposite the entrance to the Papal cross carpark, on the small side road. If you have any questions, please let me know, preferably in the comments section as sometimes I don’t see the messages in the group message section. Thanks Dayle",
