Also the time has changed back to Sunday, still going ahead for 7 pm. Tonight's meeting is on the classic philosophical self-inquiry question of to what degree are you a robot? And by the implication then to what degree can you become free of being a robot? Here are some generic questions inspired by the meeting's topic: Are You a Robot?\nAre you motivated by desires?\nAre you manipulated by urges?\nIs the world you live in merely a paradigm?\nIs reality for you only thoughts, concepts and feelings?\nIs fear, love, likes and dislikes only reactions as guides to survival?\nAre all interactions with others a means to obtaining what you need?\nAre all actions learned or innate habit patterns?\nIs ‚ÄúThat which you really are‚Äù substituted by identities?\nDo beliefs and understanding substitute for knowing?\nAre free will and freedom of choice excuses for any of these manipulations?\nWhat is the origin of your next thought?\nHow would an awake and conscious individual react to these questions?\nHow would someone mechanically-driven and internally manipulated react to these questions?\nPeople don't like to hear that they might be mechanical.\nBeing a robot suggests that we are programmed.",

It was at this location that the Norse Vikings fled to regroup after the Battle of Clontarf in 1014 and was also the point where they boarded their long boats and left Howth for the last time after the Normans invasion in 1177. In 1667 it was decided to build a light signal here to warn ships of the danger at night. The Bailey Lighthouse as you see it today was built in 1814 and it‚Äôs tower stands 134 feet above the sea. A fog bell was later added in 1853 In 1996, the lighthouse was converted to automatic operation, and the last of the Keepers left in 1997, making Baily the last Irish lighthouse to go automatic.We stop on a small beach area in the base of the cliffs for some refreshments.
