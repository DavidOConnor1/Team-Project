    "eventDetails": "The meaning of the word zen is meditation, zazen means sitting meditation. In zazen practice we begin to know ourselves, and to go beyond the limits of our personal ego. Within our tradition zazen is referred to as shikantaza, not doing, letting go of thoughts, dropping off body and mind. This sitting meditation is the focus of our practice. Language limits our ability to communicate the true nature of zen; it is something that is better understood through practice. We are open to everyone interested in learning about zen. Intro workshop for newcomers is available at 5.30pm each Sunday. The dojo is a sacred place and it is important to be considerate of everyone. We have many people that travel to practise together once a week or once a month. So for that reason it is really essential that we all know the structure of the sitting practise (when to sit, how to do Kinhin, the different bell sounds and their meaning etc), to ensure a silent, safe and meaningful meditation. And it's also great to meet everyone before the sitting practise. And answer any questions you may have. We have zafus and zabutons (mats and cushions) for all to sit on. Chairs are available too. Comfortable clothing for sitting, black or neutral tones best. We greatly appreciate a donation of ‚Ç¨5 to cover costs if it's possible for you. Please arrive 10min before start so 6ish (if you're not doing the intro workshop). You are very welcome to our dojo!",

A school gives us the opportunity to come together as a collective with the dual objective of working on the material and working on ourselves. Through the group we give ourselves a chance to change, transform and most notably, provide a space to awaken and become conscious. A movement practice will provide the platform and broad range of material to contend with. In taking part in a movement school like this I‚Äôll aim to teach material that will help you foster a lifelong movement practice that is independent in its own way and truly unique to you as an individual. We come together as a group to share that unique perspective and elevate our own understanding of movement as part of a community. The school will follow a curriculum based approach in exposing students to what I feel are fundamental practices (listed below) that relate to the field of movement. The teachings will be delivered in an organised, modular and process-based approach in order to present these various systems as a coherent body of knowledge.

A school gives us the opportunity to come together as a collective with the dual objective of working on the material and working on ourselves. Through the group we give ourselves a chance to change, transform and most notably, provide a space to awaken and become conscious. A movement practice will provide the platform and broad range of material to contend with. In taking part in a movement school like this I‚Äôll aim to teach material that will help you foster a lifelong movement practice that is independent in its own way and truly unique to you as an individual. We come together as a group to share that unique perspective and elevate our own understanding of movement as part of a community. The school will follow a curriculum based approach in exposing students to what I feel are fundamental practices (listed below) that relate to the field of movement. The teachings will be delivered in an organised, modular and process-based approach in order to present these various systems as a coherent body of knowledge.
