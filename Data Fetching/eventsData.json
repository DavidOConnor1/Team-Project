    "eventDetails": "From a Chinese medecine perspective, acupuncture helps to regulate our emotions (energy). Negative emotions block our bodies. We have four energy bodies in addition to our physical body (the etheric, emotional, mental and spiritual body). Anything that happens in the physical body has to happen first in the etheric body, which is an energy twin of the physical body. Acupuncture works on the etheric energy body which then connects with all the other bodies. So in other words, Acupuncture heals on all four levels: emotionally, mentally, physically and spiritually. It does this by balancing all the masculine (yang) and feminine (yin) energies. We need both of these to be healthy, but when these two energies are not balanced, you will feel unaligned and this will manifest as physical or mental symptons. The root cause of disease is due to emotional or mental issues. From a Western Medicine perspective, Acupuncture stimulates the nerves beside the acupuncture points along the body, sending neuro signals to the brain to release hormones, feel good chemicals and endorphins which are the bodys' natural pain killer. In other words, it helps the body to heal itself! unlike modern medications which have very bad side effects, Acupuncture is a totally safe and natural treatment with absolutely no side effects. Come along to learn about the oldest natural medicinal system used all over the world (70%) and recognised as a safe and effective treatment for many medical conditions by the World Health Organisation (WHO). We can discuss in an informal environment, about your symptons and see if acupuncture can help you. it's FREE!! to attend, and if you decide to get a treatment after the consultation, then a minimum donation of 20 euro, (but this is NOT obligatory, exclusive to meet up members only). For normal private one to one sessions, please enquire (price 50 euro). Have you been experiencing any unexplained symptons? have you been for tests but they have all come back negative, yet somehow you still feel that something is not quite right? Well it's time to sit up and listen to your body before its too late. It's trying to tell you something! When you have blockage in your body and if it is left untreated, it can develop into something very serious in the long term such as cardiac issues, cancer, alzheimers, etc. Adrenal fatigue is the state your body ends up in when you have been pushing yourself too hard for too long. Living off of adrenaline and stress hormones while not taking time to recover or recharge is detrimental to your health, and the feeling of adrenal fatigue can be mild to severe and includes four different stages. The most common symptoms include feeling chronically tired and run-down no matter how much you sleep, an inability to focus, a low tolerance to sound and bright lights, sleep disturbances, feeling tired yet wired at night, or wanting to sleep all the time. Other symptoms can be that stimulants don't work like they used to, you have low immunity and get sick more frequently, and you feel overwhelmed with day-to-day responsibilities. Acupuncture can help to restore your energy levels, and bring your mind and body back to balance, thereby improving all symptons.",

    "eventDetails": "The meaning of the word zen is meditation, zazen means sitting meditation. In zazen practice we begin to know ourselves, and to go beyond the limits of our personal ego. Within our tradition zazen is referred to as shikantaza, not doing, letting go of thoughts, dropping off body and mind. This sitting meditation is the focus of our practice. Language limits our ability to communicate the true nature of zen; it is something that is better understood through practice. We are open to everyone interested in learning about zen. Intro workshop for newcomers is available at 5.30pm each Sunday. The dojo is a sacred place and it is important to be considerate of everyone. We have many people that travel to practise together once a week or once a month. So for that reason it is really essential that we all know the structure of the sitting practise (when to sit, how to do Kinhin, the different bell sounds and their meaning etc), to ensure a silent, safe and meaningful meditation. And it's also great to meet everyone before the sitting practise. And answer any questions you may have. We have zafus and zabutons (mats and cushions) for all to sit on. Chairs are available too. Comfortable clothing for sitting, black or neutral tones best. We greatly appreciate a donation of ‚Ç¨5 to cover costs if it's possible for you. Please arrive 10min before start so 6ish (if you're not doing the intro workshop). You are very welcome to our dojo!",

    "eventDetails": "(Graphics are by Don Sebach 1974) We have changed our venue to the Maldron Hotel in Tallaght. Directions are given below. Also the time has changed back to Sunday, still going ahead for 7 pm. Tonight's meeting is on the classic philosophical self-inquiry question of to what degree are you a robot? And by the implication then to what degree can you become free of being a robot? Here are some generic questions inspired by the meeting's topic: Are You a Robot? Are you motivated by desires? Are you manipulated by urges? Is the world you live in merely a paradigm? Is reality for you only thoughts, concepts and feelings? Is fear, love, likes and dislikes only reactions as guides to survival? Are all interactions with others a means to obtaining what you need? Are all actions learned or innate habit patterns? Is ‚ÄúThat which you really are‚Äù substituted by identities? Do beliefs and understanding substitute for knowing? Are free will and freedom of choice excuses for any of these manipulations? What is the origin of your next thought? How would an awake and conscious individual react to these questions? How would someone mechanically-driven and internally manipulated react to these questions? People don't like to hear that they might be mechanical. Being a robot suggests that we are programmed.",

(sure I didn't have any before I joined and now I'm hosting these meetups!) This is also a good meetup if you want to help us find donated bikes, recipient organizations, or general logistics of delivery. You can help without touching a single bike if that's your speed! What to bring: Clothes you do not mind getting dirty Comfy shoes, you will be standing-walking on a wooden floor. How it works:",
