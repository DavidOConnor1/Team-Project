Celebrating Rough Magic's 40th anniversary, Hilary Fannin‚Äôs radical adaptation of Maxim Gorky‚Äôs classic 1905 dark comedy reworks the original text and draws it into the here and now. Telling the story of how a small family, their odd rattle-bag of friends and one quixotic stranger distract, entertain and enrage each other over a 24-hour period, while beyond their fragile walls their world is being reshaped by inexorable forces. Please secure your ticket online or at the Abbey Theatre box office (‚Ç¨15 - ‚Ç¨29, concessions available). Welcome to add your seat number to the comments so others can secure adjacent seats. Can meet at the upstairs Abbey bar before the performance and at the interval. \"If art has any purpose, it should make us feel better.\"\nChildren of the Sun",
